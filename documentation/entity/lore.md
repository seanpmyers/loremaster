# Lore

## Definition

> a body of traditions and knowledge on a subject or held by a particular group, typically passed from person to person by word of mouth.

Lore is an abstraction that refers to the majority of the information you record through the application.

This includes actions, documents, protocols, daily chronicles, etc.

I think people are the culmination of all the different things they think, do, write, and say.

So in that way lore is all the information that makes up the person you are or want to be.
