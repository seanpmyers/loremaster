A *person* can create documentation for any subject matter they need with a *document*.
A *document* is a record with text written by the *person*.

A *Chronicle* is a log or recording of your daily actions and *documents*.
*Chronicles* are the basic way to track progress of a *person's* *actions* and progress towards their *intentions*.  
*Chronicles* are auto generated every day. There cannot be more than one chronicle for a given day.

When *actions* have been documented, they can then be planned with a *schedule*.  
This allows a *person* to set *actions* they want to complete on set intervals, for example they could plan daily actions to brush their teeth or practice leetcode.   
These *scheduled* *actions* will appear on relevant *chronicles* to help the user track their activity.
