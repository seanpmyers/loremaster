# Person

User of the application.

The main focus of the application is the user.  
Ideally the app can help the user plan, document, and track their life.  

It is difficult to determine what is the right amount of information to link to individuals in the app.  
Ideally this application would maximize privacy of it's users, but given the nature of the application it may be difficult.  
Encrypting all user's data using their password might be possible, although the technical limitations that might impose are unknown as of writing this.  
This application's functionality and utility require the user to provide detailed private and personal information.  
Being able to leverage user data to improve the quality and functionality of the application is also a possibility that must be considered.  
Certain data entities like actions, schedules, and intentions can possibly be reused by other users. This would reduce the overall required effort by individual users.
