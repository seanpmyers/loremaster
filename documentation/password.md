# Password

## What
Passwords are basically a key to unlock user data. We are making the decision to only allow the user to create, read, update, and delete their own data. In order to achieve this we need a way to identify that the user is who they say they are. Therefore we request that the user provide a unique key that will be used for all future unlocking of their data.
