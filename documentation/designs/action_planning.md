# Action Planning

- [`chronicle`]
- [`action`]
- [`feature`]

Chronicles represent all the lore associated with a given date in time.

Being able to track and plan actions/tasks/routines is one of the most important features for me currently.

I think actions is still a good encompassing word for the concept I am trying to capture.

Actions have multiple dimensions to them.

Examples:

- `duration`
  - actions can occur over a period of time or in an instant
- `frequency`
  - actions can be taken yearly, monthly, daily, hourly, etc.
  - could be every Thursday and Sunday
  - could be the first day of every quarter of the year
  - could be a desired number of completions within a repeated time-frame
  - could use a time range since the last completion time
- `procedure`
  - a series of actions completed in a certain order or manner
- `routine`
  - a collection of actions taken on a recurring basis
- `contingent actions`
  - occurring or existing only if (certain circumstances) are the case; dependent on something else
- `outcome`
  - what is the result of an action taken, if there is one
  - positive/negatives -- pros/cons -- risk/reward
  - anticipated vs actual outcome (pros/cons)
  - confidence level in outcome before taking the action

In order to fully implement `action planning`, I think most of these concepts ought to be included.
