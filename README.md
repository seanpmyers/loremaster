[![Build Status](https://github.com/seanpmyers/loremaster/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/seanpmyers/loremaster/actions)

Streamlined planning and tracking of life goals, actions, and outcomes.

## Intentions

I have a desire to properly track how the actions I take everday work towards my desired objectives and convictions.

I also want to be able to map out the mundane tasks of my life, and reduce the amount of mental energy I spend thinking about things that I need to do.

The goal of this application is to attempt to achieve the above objectives, but I also generally enjoy building software and learning new technologies.

List of intentions:

- Copy all personally important information from ones head and store it into one organized location.
- Improve the life of the user.
- Improve the user's ability to plan for the future.
- Reduce effort to organize and track past/future actions taken in life.
- Reduce the need of ones brain to keep track of mundane information.
- Reflect on how one's actions match their life convictions/objectives.
