## User Story

A *person* (user) opens the application.

The *person* starts with some *intention* they have (an objective or goal).  

Intention: Get a new Job

Plan the *actions* they must take to enact their intention.  
*Actions* can have *contingent actions* (basically sub tasks) that must be completed first.  
They can record an optional *outcome* for every action they take (what was the result of the action).   
For example if they complete and interview, they might be rejected which is an outcome or result. 

Actions:
  - Apply
    - Send Resume
      - Update Resume
        - Create Resume
    - Send Cover Letter
      - Write Cover Letter
  - Interview
    - Schedule date/time with company contact
    - Prepare
      - Practice
        - Leetcode
        - Whiteboarding
      - Study Role Topics
      - Read about company
      - Read about role
  - Accept Offer
  - Reject Offer

A *person* can create documentation for any subject matter they need with a *document*.
A *document* is a record with text written by the *person*.

A *Chronicle* is a log or recording of your daily actions and *documents*.
*Chronicles* are the basic way to track progress of a *person's* *actions* and progress towards their *intentions*.  
*Chronicles* are auto generated every day. There cannot be more than one chronicle for a given day.

When *actions* have been documented, they can then be planned with a *schedule*.  
This allows a *person* to set *actions* they want to complete on set intervals, for example they could plan daily actions to brush their teeth or practice leetcode.   
These *scheduled* *actions* will appear on relevant *chronicles* to help the user track their activity.
